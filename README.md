# Missile-Command

This is my take on replicating an Atari 2600 game "Missile Command". Although, this replication needs a lot of additional work, code refactoring, game balancing as in its' current state the game is...boring a bit and much more.

The goal of my replica is to survive as long as you can, until the life count drops to zero. The rockets will come from the sky to the ground and player should destroy those rockets with their own. Even though, the original game has a bit refined version of the goal, which is to protect 6 cities for as long as you can, but again, it's an unfinished product.
